# Simulation-of-OFDM-in-5G-NR
Simulation of downlink transmission in 5G NR with provision to select desired sub carrier spacing (SCS), bandwidth (BW) and quadrature Amplitude modulation scheme (QAM) 

This repository contains:
1. REPORT - Gives a brief outline and the procedure to use the simulation tool
2. CODE - MATLAB code of implementation
